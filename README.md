# DogPortraits
This project makes use of the dog online api, link here: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/. The UI of the page of this project will include a button to generate a random dog image with the API. It will then have additional input options to style the border around the image, and will visually demonstrate the changes to the user as they pick from their choice.
